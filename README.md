## 📚 Getting Started with the Labs

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed and configured
- API key set: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"`
- Development environment for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java
- VS Code (optional, for IDE integration demonstrations)
- Docker (optional, for MCP and containerized workflow examples)

### Lab Structure
The `lab_handout.md` contains six progressive labs:

0. **Project Creation from Scratch** - Build a lyrics display app (recreates the `lyrics-trainer` origin story)
1. **Claude Code Basics** - Interface and project exploration
2. **Code Exploration** - Understanding complex codebases
3. **Test Generation** - Automated testing with AI
4. **Documentation Creation** - Professional documentation workflows
5. **Legacy Code Refactoring** - Modernizing Grails/Groovy applications
6. **Advanced Workflows** - Plan Mode, Skills, Plugins, Output Styles, Hooks, CLAUDE.md, and custom commands

### Custom Commands
Students can explore and use pre-built custom slash commands:
- Copy commands from `commands/` to `~/.claude/commands/`
- See `custom-commands.md` for detailed explanations and usage examples
- Commands include Java modernization, Spring generators, security reviews, and more

### Teaching Notes
The `exercises.md` file contains detailed instructor guidance with specific prompts and a progressive story arc using the `flask-api` project as the primary demonstration vehicle.
