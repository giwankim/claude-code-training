# Claude Code Training: Demos and Exercises

This document outlines suggested demos and exercises for the projects in the `exercises` directory. The projects offer a diverse mix of languages, frameworks, and code quality, perfect for showcasing the capabilities of an AI coding assistant.

---

### Core Best Practice: The "Branch-First" Workflow

Before starting any exercise that involves significant code changes, get into the habit of creating a new Git branch. This is the most important safety measure you can take. It isolates your work, allows for fearless experimentation, and makes it easy to discard changes if they don't work out, all without affecting the `main` branch.

**Recommended Branching Strategy for Exercises:**

Since this is a training course with multiple projects in one repository, use a simple local branching approach:

1. **Create a branch for each exercise:** Use descriptive names based on the exercise
   - Examples: `flask-api-refactor`, `weather-app-forecast`, `lyrics-trainer-debug`
   
2. **Work locally:** No need to push branches - this is just for practice and experimentation

3. **Easy reset:** If you want to start over, simply:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b new-attempt
   ```

4. **Commit as you go:** Create checkpoints for your progress
   ```bash
   git commit -m "test: add pytest suite"
   git commit -m "refactor: extract database logic"
   ```

**Example Prompt:** `Using git, create a new feature branch called 'flask-api-refactor' and switch to it.`

    *   **Point out:** No manual skill activation needed - it's contextual

*   **Demo: Installing a Custom Skill**
    ```bash
    # Show the skill directory structure
    ls -la skills-and-plugins/spring-boot-skill/

    # Install it locally
    cp -r skills-and-plugins/spring-boot-skill ~/.claude/skills/
    ```

    *   **Prompt:** `Create a new Spring Boot REST controller for handling training certificates with full CRUD operations.`
    *   **Observe:** The Spring Boot skill activates, applying team standards automatically
    *   **Point out:** Notice constructor injection, JavaDoc, proper package structure

*   **Exercise: Create Your Own Skill**
    *   **Prompt:** `Help me create a custom skill for our team's testing standards. It should enforce:
        - Use of AssertJ for assertions
        - @DisplayName annotations on all tests
        - Given-When-Then comment structure
        - Proper test isolation
        Save it to ~/.claude/skills/team-testing-standards/`
    *   **Follow up:** `Now write tests for CertificateService using this new skill`
    *   **Observe:** The skill activates and applies your standards

*   **Discussion Points:**
    - Skills persist across conversations (unlike one-time prompts)
    - Three-tier loading: metadata (always), instructions (when triggered), resources (as needed)
    - Skills vs. custom commands: When to use each
    - Team collaboration: Sharing skills via version control

### 7. Plugins: Team-Wide Standardization

**Project:** Demonstration without active coding

Plugins bundle commands, skills, hooks, and MCP servers into installable packages for team distribution.

**Demo Sequence:**

*   **Demo: Plugin Architecture**
    *   Open and review `skills-and-plugins/plugin-examples/team-standards-plugin.md`
    *   Show the plugin.json structure
    *   Explain how plugins bundle multiple capabilities:
        - Custom slash commands
        - Domain-specific skills
        - Validation hooks
        - MCP server configurations
        - Team templates

*   **Demo: Plugin Use Cases**
    *   **Enterprise scenario:** "Imagine Acme Corp has 50 Java developers"
    *   **Problem:** How do you ensure consistent:
        - Code generation patterns
        - Security review processes
        - API standards
        - Testing approaches
    *   **Solution:** Create an `acme-corp-standards` plugin
    *   **Distribution:** `/plugin install acme-corp-standards`
    *   **Result:** All developers instantly get:
        - `/service` command for Spring Boot services
        - Security review hooks
        - Internal API MCP servers
        - Company-wide skills

*   **Demo: Plugin Marketplace Configuration**
    *   Show `~/.claude/settings.json` configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "extraKnownMarketplaces": [
        {
          "name": "Acme Internal",
          "url": "https://plugins.acme.corp/marketplace.json"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    *   Explain marketplace discoverability vs. direct installation

*   **Exercise: Design Your Team's Plugin**
    *   Have students design (not implement) a plugin for their organization

### 8. Output Styles: Adaptive Communication

**Project:** Any project (use `weather-app` for variety)

Output styles customize how Claude presents solutions to match different contexts and learning preferences.

**Demo Sequence:**

*   **Demo: Built-in Styles Comparison**
    ```bash
    # Start with explanatory style
    claude --output-style explanatory
    ```

    *   **Prompt:** `Explain how the weather API integration works in this Flask app`
    *   **Note:** Observe verbose, educational explanations

    Exit and restart:
    ```bash
    claude --output-style learning
    ```

    *   **Same Prompt:** `Explain how the weather API integration works in this Flask app`
    *   **Compare:** Even more detailed, step-by-step teaching approach

*   **Demo: Creating Custom Output Styles**
    *   **Scenario:** "In production, we want concise, expert-level responses"
    *   **Prompt:** `Create a custom output style called 'production' with these characteristics:
        - Concise and action-focused
        - Skip explanations unless explicitly asked
        - Assume expert-level knowledge
        - Show code without preambles
        - Use technical terminology freely
        Save it to ~/.claude/output-styles/production.md`

    *   **Test it:**
    ```bash
    claude --output-style production
    ```

    *   **Same Prompt:** `Explain how the weather API integration works`
    *   **Compare:** Notice the terse, expert-oriented response

*   **Demo: When to Use Each Style**
    *   **Explanatory:** Onboarding new team members, code reviews
    *   **Learning:** Training sessions, teaching unfamiliar concepts
    *   **Production:** Experienced developers, quick fixes
    *   **Custom:** Match your team's communication culture

*   **Exercise: Style for Your Context**
    *   **Prompt:** `Create an output style for code review sessions that:
        - Focuses on potential issues and improvements
        - Provides specific fix recommendations
        - Explains the reasoning behind suggestions
        - Uses a constructive, collaborative tone`
    *   Test with: `Review the error handling in weather_service.py`

*   **Discussion Points:**
    - Output styles don't change Claude's capabilities, only presentation
    - Can be set per-session or as default
    - Consider creating styles for different team roles
    - Balance verbosity with developer experience level

### 9. Hooks: Workflow Automation

**Project:** `weather-app` or `certificate-service`

Hooks execute shell commands in response to Claude Code events, enabling sophisticated workflow automation.

**Demo Sequence:**

*   **Demo: SessionEnd Hook**
    ```bash
    # Install the session summary hook
    cp hooks-examples/session-end-summary.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
    chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/session-end-summary.sh
    ```

    *   **Prompt:** `Configure a sessionEnd hook in my settings.json to run ~/.claude/hooks/session-end-summary.sh`
    *   Work through a few file edits and commits
    *   Exit Claude Code
    *   **Show:** The generated session summary with statistics

*   **Demo: PreToolUse Hook - Security Validation**
    ```bash
    # Install security validator
    cp hooks-examples/security-validator.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
    chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/security-validator.sh
    ```

    *   **Prompt:** `Add a preToolUse hook for Write operations that runs security-validator.sh`

    *   **Test it - This should BLOCK:**
    *   **Prompt:** `Create a config.py file with: API_KEY = "sk_live_1234567890abcdef"`
    *   **Observe:** Hook blocks the operation, explains the security issue

    *   **Fix it:**
    *   **Prompt:** `Update that to use environment variables: API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")`
    *   **Observe:** Hook allows the operation

*   **Demo: PreToolUse Hook - Auto-Formatting**
    ```bash
    # Install formatter hook
    cp hooks-examples/pre-edit-formatter.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
    chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/pre-edit-formatter.sh
    ```

    *   **Prompt:** `Add a preToolUse hook for Edit operations that auto-formats files`
    *   Make an edit to a Python file with poor formatting
    *   **Observe:** Hook auto-formats before the edit is applied
    *   **Point out:** Hooks run transparently, maintaining code quality

*   **Demo: Hook Feedback is User Input**
    *   When a hook blocks an operation, its output appears as if from the user
    *   Claude adjusts behavior based on hook feedback
    *   This creates a collaborative safety net

*   **Exercise: Build a Test Runner Hook**
    *   **Prompt:** `Create a hook that runs pytest before any git commit operation. If tests fail, block the commit.`
    *   **Test it:** Make a change that breaks tests, attempt to commit
    *   **Observe:** Hook prevents broken code from being committed

*   **Discussion Points:**
    - Exit code 0 = allow, non-zero = block
    - Hooks should be fast (they run synchronously)
    - Use hooks for: validation, formatting, security, backups
    - Project vs. user-level hook configuration
    - Hook can modify tool inputs (v2.0.10+)

---

### 10. Subagents: Specialized Task Handlers

**Project:** `flask-api` for comprehensive demonstration

Subagents are autonomous specialized agents that Claude launches automatically for specific task types.

**Demo Sequence:**

*   **Demo: Exploring Subagent Types**
    *   **Prompt:** `Explain which subagents you use and when each activates automatically`
    *   **Review:** Plan, Explore, Testing, Documentation subagents
    *   **Key point:** You don't manually select these - Claude chooses optimally

*   **Demo: Plan Subagent (Plan Mode)**
    *   Press `Shift+Tab+Tab` to activate Plan Mode
    *   **Prompt:** `Plan a comprehensive refactoring to modernize this Flask app with blueprints, better error handling, and structured logging`
    *   **Observe:** Plan subagent creates detailed strategy
    *   **Point out:** This uses strategic decomposition, different from direct execution
    *   Approve the plan and watch step-by-step execution

*   **Demo: Explore Subagent**
    *   **Prompt:** `Find all API endpoints in this codebase and explain their authentication requirements`
    *   **Observe:** Explore subagent activates automatically
    *   **Point out:** Faster than general-purpose exploration
    *   **Show:** Systematic codebase search results

*   **Demo: Testing Subagent**
    *   **Prompt:** `Generate comprehensive test coverage for all API endpoints with edge cases and error scenarios`
    *   **Observe:** Testing subagent generates structured test suite
    *   **Point out:** Specialized knowledge of testing frameworks and patterns

*   **Demo: Documentation Subagent**
    *   **Prompt:** `Create complete API documentation for all endpoints with examples and error codes`
    *   **Observe:** Documentation subagent produces professional docs
    *   **Point out:** Different writing style than general responses

*   **Demo: Model Selection for Subagents**
    *   Explain that different subagents can use different models
    *   Fast subagents (Explore) might use Haiku
    *   Complex subagents (Plan) might use Opus
    *   This optimizes both cost and performance

*   **Discussion Points:**
    - Subagents are transparent - you see when they activate
    - They're automatic - no manual selection needed
    - They specialize both tools and reasoning
    - Different from custom commands (which are templates)
    - Think of them as "expert consultants" Claude calls in

---

### 11. Orchestrating Multiple Features

**Project:** `certificate-service` (final comprehensive demo)

Demonstrate how Skills, Hooks, Output Styles, and Subagents work together seamlessly.

**Demo Sequence:**

*   **Setup: Configure the Environment**
    ```bash
    # Ensure skills are installed
    ls ~/.claude/skills/spring-boot-skill/

    # Ensure hooks are configured
    cat ~/.claude/settings.json  # Show security hook

    # Set production output style
    claude --output-style production
    ```

*   **Demo: Complete Feature Development**
    *   Activate Plan Mode: `Shift+Tab+Tab`
    *   **Prompt:** `Plan and implement a new training transcript PDF generation feature with:
        - REST controller following our Spring Boot standards
        - Service layer with business logic
        - Comprehensive tests
        - API documentation
        - Security validation (no secrets in code)
        Generate the PDF documentation when done.`

    *   **Observe the Orchestration:**
        1. Plan subagent creates implementation strategy
        2. Spring Boot skill activates for code generation
        3. Security hook validates no hardcoded secrets
        4. Testing skill ensures proper test coverage
        5. PDF skill generates documentation
        6. Production style keeps responses concise

    *   **Point out:** All features working together automatically

*   **Demo: Session Wrap-up**
    *   Complete some commits
    *   Exit Claude Code
    *   **Show:** SessionEnd hook generates summary
    *   Review what was accomplished with all tools working together

*   **Reflection Questions:**
    - Which features provided the most value?
    - How would you configure this for your team?
    - What custom skills would help your workflow?
    - What hooks would enforce your quality gates?

---

## Teaching Tips for Advanced Features

**Pacing:**
- Introduce one feature at a time
- Show before explaining - demos are more powerful than theory
- Let students experiment immediately after each demo

**Common Questions:**

*Q: When should I use a skill vs. a custom command?*
- **Skills:** Persistent domain expertise that activates contextually
- **Commands:** Quick shortcuts for repetitive prompts
- **Example:** Spring Boot standards = skill; "create service" = command

*Q: Are hooks required?*
- No, they're optional workflow enhancements
- Start without hooks, add as needs arise
- Great for teams with strict quality gates

*Q: Do output styles affect code quality?*
- No, only presentation style
- Same underlying capabilities and reasoning
- Choose based on context and audience

*Q: Can I control which subagent activates?*
- No, Claude selects automatically for optimal results
- Trust the system - it's designed to choose correctly
- Plan Mode is the only manually triggered subagent

**Troubleshooting:**

*Skills not activating:*
- Check YAML frontmatter format
- Verify directory location (~/.claude/skills/)
- Skill descriptions must match task context

*Hooks failing silently:*
- Check execute permissions (chmod +x)
- Validate JSON syntax in settings
- Review hook script for errors

*Output style not applying:*
- Verify file location (~/.claude/output-styles/)
- Check YAML frontmatter
- Restart claude with --output-style flag
